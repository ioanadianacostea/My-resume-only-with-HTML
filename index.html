                <h1 id="personName">Ioana-Diana Costea</h1>   
                <p align="justify">My skills and work experience help me to focus very well on results, to manage several projects at the same time, and to bring value to the team. I am a person of attention to details, I have a knack for problem-solving and work very well in a team environment as well as individual. I respond to requests in a timely manner, and I am adept at prioritizing and manage multiple ongoing projects. Additionally, I have great experience working with different programs, such as Fidelio, Micros, Confluence, Dimensions, various CRM systems in my day-to-day operations. Lately I started learning HTML, CSS and Python. I am also deeply familiar with All Microsoft Tools (including advanced Excel work skills) and adapt quickly to any new programs. I feel the need to constantly put my mind to the contribution, and I am convinced that for me the key to success is to learn something new all the time.</p>
